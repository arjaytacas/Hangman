# 🕵️ Hangman Game (Python)

A simple terminal-based Hangman game that randomly selects a word from a curated list and challenges the player to guess it one letter at a time.

## 📦 Features
- Random word selection from custom wordlist
- Real-time input and display update
- Tracks correct guesses and reveals the word gradually
- Modular design for future UI upgrades (e.g., Tkinter)

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure `wordlist.py` exists and contains:  
```python
wordlist = ["oxygen", "chandelier", "awkward", ...]
```
3. Run the game:
```Bash
python main.py
```
## 🎯 To-Do
- Integrate a GUI (Tkinter or web-based)

## ✨ Inspiration
Built for fun and practice—curated wordlist includes tricky spellings, aesthetic themes, and workplace lingo.
